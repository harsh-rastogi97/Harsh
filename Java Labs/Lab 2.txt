Question 1-

// Write a program to input two numbers and find the maximum between two numbers using the conditional/ternary operator.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class GreatestBetweenTwo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		try {
			
			// Taking two numbers from the user
			System.out.print("Enter First Number: ");
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter Second Number: ");
			int b = sc.nextInt();
			
			// Finding the maximum between the two numbers
			int max = (a > b)? a : b;
			System.out.println(max + " is maximum between the two numbers");
		}
		catch(Exception e) {
			
			System.out.println(e);
		}
		finally {
			
			// Closing the Scanner
			sc.close();
		}
	}
}


OUTPUT-
Enter First Number: 523
Enter Second Number: 286
523 is maximum between the two numbers



Question 2-

// Write a program to declare a variable for integer number. Assign a value to it and shift it to left and right using shift operators.
// You can use shift by 1 place, shift by 2 places. Print output for both left & right shifts.

public class ShiftOperator {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// Shift operator takes binary version of the number and shifts the bit to specified number of places
		int num = 100;
		
		// Shift by 1 place
		System.out.println("Right Shift by 1 place: " + (num >> 1));
		System.out.println("Left Shift by 1 place: " + (num << 1));
		
		// Shift by 2 place
		System.out.println("Right Shift by 2 place: " + (num >> 2));
		System.out.println("Left Shift by 2 place: " + (num << 2));
	}
}


OUTPUT-
Right Shift by 1 place: 50
Left Shift by 1 place: 200
Right Shift by 2 place: 25
Left Shift by 2 place: 400
